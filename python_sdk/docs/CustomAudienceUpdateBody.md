Only data not included in the original file will be added. REMOVE: Upload files to remove the Customer File audience. Only the data that coincide with the original file will be removed. REPLACE: Upload files to replace the Customer File audience. All the data in the original file will be replaced. Default value: REPLACE.

**audience_sub_type** | **str** | Audience sub type, indicating the type of ads that the audience can be used for. The allowed enum value: REACH_FREQUENCY(To enable the audience to be used in Reach &amp; Frequency campaigns). It means you can only convert audience sub type from NORMAL to REACH_FREQUENCY, but not the other way round. Note: If you update this field, changes to other data fields will be ignored.
